# Amazon_Link_Web_Scrapper
Note: Uses BeautifulSoup which needs to be installed manualy (pip-install available)  
Program scraps amazon.com links for the price and checks that price with a wanted price given by the user. If the original price has fallen below the given price, the program will send an email alert to notify the user the price has changed. The program will do this for a list of Page objects, which are created with a URL and a wanted price.  Thanks and Enjoy!
